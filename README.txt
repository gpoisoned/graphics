// Basic Key Bindings:
a => toggle Axis
l => toggle Lighting
s => toggle spotlight
m => toggle between moveCamera mode
ARROW keys => controls rotation or forward/backward depending on mode

// Known Issues
1. The spotlight isn't working correctly. I feel like I have the parameters 
right but it just doesn't work. The idea is to have the lamp control the 
spotlight but for now, testing at a different point. 

2. Right now, switching to moving camera mode, the line of sight stays constant
so user can only move forward and backward in the same line. However, pressing
the left or right keys, the user can navigate the scene. 
I need to fix this so that the user can go to any place in the scene using the 
arrow keys.
